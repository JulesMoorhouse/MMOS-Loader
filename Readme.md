# MMOS-Loader 

The loader program is called with a shortcut parameter to load and run all the MMOS programs. Files are copied / pull down from the server folder. Also checks for required system files are also performed.

The idea behind this is to allow for programs to be updated and easily deployed. The loader will check for new files and copy them before running them.

The loader program is displayed as a small blue bar on the top left of the screen.
